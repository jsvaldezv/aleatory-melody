# ðŸŽ² Quantum Aleatoric Composer â€“ Python + Amazon Braket

This project is a tool for aleatory (random) music composition that generates melodies based on a chosen musical scale. It was built with Python and includes an experimental implementation using a quantum computer (IonQ) via Amazon Braket, enabling the generation of true randomness for musical creativity.

ðŸ§¬ Key Features:

- Generates random melodies within a selected musical scale
- Python-based version for standard random generation
- Quantum version using IonQ on Amazon Braket for true randomness
- Explore the intersection of algorithmic composition and quantum computing
- Ideal for experimental composers, researchers, and curious developers

This tool is a creative exploration of how quantum computing can be used to inspire new musical ideas through aleatory processes.

## Local running

### 1. Create venv
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run main file
```bash
(venv) python main.py
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Run black to format your files with Python coding standards
```bash
(venv) black .
```
